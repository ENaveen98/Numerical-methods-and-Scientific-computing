#### me16b077_1 => Finite Precision Numbers and Recurrence Relations
- This section is dedicated to the very fundamentals of how numbers are manipulated in machines where we cannot represent a number upto infinite precision. 
- Hence the name Finite Precision Numbers and the corresponding machine in which it operates as Finite Precision Machines.
